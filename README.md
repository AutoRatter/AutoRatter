## What it does

AutoRatter is a ChatTriggers module for Minecraft 1.8.9 (and soon Fabric 1.21.5) that adds many useful features for sniping in [Hypixel SkyBlock](https://wiki.hypixel.net/Main_Page).

Using AutoRatter you have access to:
* **Lobby Scanning:** Scan an entire lobby at once for all valuable items such as exotics, OG Fairy, crystal, and even skins or seymour.
* **Player Scanning:** Scan a single player's profile for all valuable items such as exotics, OG Fairy, crystal, and even skins or seymour.
* **World Scanning:** Scan islands for valuable items inside of item frames, armor stands, and showcase blocks.
* **Item Highlighting:** Hightlight valuable items in the inventory to see at a glace what items are special.
* **Item Tooltips:** Add many useful features to item tooltips and lore such as timestamps, hex codes, and seymour piece values.
* [And **much** more!](FEATURE_LIST.md)

AutoRatter is especially useful when determining whether a player still has their exotic items, one scan and you know exactly where they are.
